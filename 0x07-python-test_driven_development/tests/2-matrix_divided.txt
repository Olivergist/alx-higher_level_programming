Title: Test Script for matrix_divided Function

Description:
This test script evaluates the 'matrix_divided' function, which is designed to divide all elements of a matrix by a given number while performing extensive type and size validations. The function should produce a new matrix with the elements divided by the specified number, rounded to two decimal places.

Usage:
1. Import the 'matrix_divided' function.
2. Call the function with a matrix (a list of lists) and a division factor (integer or float).
3. The function will return a new matrix with elements divided by the factor.

Test Cases:
--------------------------

Test Case 1: Basic Division
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[2, 4, 6],
 [8, 10, 12]]

Division Factor: 2

Expected Result:
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
 [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Explanation:
Each element in the matrix is divided by 2, resulting in the expected output.

--------------------------

Test Case 2: Division by Float
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[3.5, 7.5],
 [10.5, 12.75]]

Division Factor: 1.5

Expected Result:
[[2.33, 5.0],
 [7.0, 8.5]]

Explanation:
The matrix elements are divided by 1.5, rounded to two decimal places.

--------------------------

Test Case 3: Invalid Matrix (Not a List)
--------------------------
Matrix:
"Invalid"

Division Factor: 2

Expected Result: TypeError (matrix must be a list of lists of integers/floats)

Explanation:
The matrix is not a list; the function should raise a TypeError.

--------------------------

Test Case 4: Non-numeric Element in Matrix
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[1, 2, '3'],
 [4, 5, 6]]

Division Factor: 2

Expected Result: TypeError (matrix must be a list of lists of integers/floats)

Explanation:
An element ('3') in the matrix is not an integer or float, so the function should raise a TypeError.

--------------------------

Test Case 5: Non-uniform Matrix Rows
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8]]

Division Factor: 2

Expected Result: TypeError (Each row of the matrix must have the same size)

Explanation:
The third row has a different size than the first two; the function should raise a TypeError.

--------------------------

Test Case 6: Division by Zero
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[1, 2],
 [3, 4]]

Division Factor: 0

Expected Result: ZeroDivisionError (division by zero)

Explanation:
The division factor is 0, which should result in a ZeroDivisionError.

--------------------------

Test Case 7: Usage with Empty Matrix
--------------------------
Matrix: []

Division Factor: 5

Expected Result: []

Explanation:
An empty matrix is provided; the function should return an empty matrix.

--------------------------

Test Case 8: Division by Float with Negative Values
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[-2, -4, -6],
 [-8, -10, -12]]

Division Factor: 1.5

Expected Result:
[[-1.33, -2.67, -4.0],
 [-5.33, -6.67, -8.0]]

Explanation:
Negative integer elements are divided by 1.5, rounded to two decimal places.

--------------------------

Test Case 9: Division by Float with Zero as Factor
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[1, 2],
 [3, 4]]

Division Factor: 0.0

Expected Result: ZeroDivisionError (division by zero)

Explanation:
The division factor is set to 0.0, which should result in a ZeroDivisionError.

--------------------------

Test Case 10: Usage with Empty Sublists
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[], []]

Division Factor: 5

Expected Result: []

Explanation:
The matrix consists of empty sublists; the function should return an empty matrix.

--------------------------

Test Case 11: Division by a Negative Float Factor
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[5, 10],
 [15, 20]]

Division Factor: -2.5

Expected Result:
[[-2.0, -4.0],
 [-6.0, -8.0]]

Explanation:
The elements are divided by -2.5, rounded to two decimal places.

--------------------------

Test Case 12: Invalid Division Factor (Not a Number)
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[1, 2],
 [3, 4]]

Division Factor: "invalid"

Expected Result: TypeError (div must be a number)

Explanation:
The division factor is not a number; the function should raise a TypeError.

--------------------------

Test Case 13: Division by a Large Float Factor
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6]]

Division Factor: 1000.5

Expected Result:
[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
 [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]

Explanation:
The division factor is significantly larger than the elements, resulting in a new matrix with all elements equal to 0.0.

--------------------------

Test Case 14: Usage with a Large Matrix
--------------------------
Matrix:
[[1] * 1000] * 1000

Division Factor: 2

Expected Result:
[[0.5] * 1000] * 1000

Explanation:
A large matrix with all elements set to 1 is divided by 2,
